# django-content
This Django application was part of CoMeUP, Albumit auki and Plok.in projects years ago.
Currently I'm porting this to support Python 3.6+ and Django 2.2+. 

Django-content can store any kind of files, providing previews of video, image and PDF files.

## Objectives
* Python 3.6 and newer supported
* Django 2.2 and forthcoming 3.x supported
* Installable python module, perhaps with pip from pypi
* Sufficient test coverage
* Find alternatives for ImageMagick, Ghostscript and other dependencies
